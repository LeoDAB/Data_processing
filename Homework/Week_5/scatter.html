    <h3>Creating a scatter plot using d3</h3>
    <p>
        Via this scatter plot you gain a general idea about the correlation between percentage of female researchers and consumer confidence for six countries. <br>
        More precisely for the countries: France, Germany, Korea, the Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom. The time period is 2007 - 2015. Logically <br>
        the percentage of female researchers is based on the total headcount of researchers in a country. For consumer confidence a number below 100 represents <br>
        a pessimistic outlook on the future economic situation which may result in more saving and less consuming and vice versa for a number above 100. Since <br>
        you can basically draw an imaginary straight line (without a slope) through each scatter plot I assume there isn't any correlation between the two variables <br>
        However, adding a regression line and calculating R squared would better support this assumption than just eyeballing the graphs. The general basis of how <br>
        this scatter plot is build using d3 v5 and javascript is explained in these online examples:
