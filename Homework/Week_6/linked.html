    <h3>Not so linked views using d3</h3>
    <p> The idea was to have a scatter plot showing the relation between percentage of voters and the employment rate of a country. And if you were <br>
        hovering over a dot the corresponding group in de grouped bar chart would change appearance as well. As in losing some of its opacity which you <br>
        now see if you hover somewhere on the grouped bar chart. However, I haven't worked out how to link those two parts. So no linked views for me. Just <br>
        two seperate plots. The grouped bar chart shows you to percentage of total, female and male population that voted in a European country. As you can <br>
        the percentages are pretty even. Therefore, there isn't much inequality in european countries as it comes to voting. Which is great news for Aletta Jacobs.
