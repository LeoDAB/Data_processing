Visually analyzing the histogram for GDP in central tendancy, it became clear that an outlier was distorting the shape of the initial
histogram. The outlier is the GDP for Suriname which according to the data is 400000. A quick google search will show that this is not 
the actual GDP of Suriname. According to Google - searching for: GDP suriname per capita - the GDP per capita is approximately 5900. 
The method to determine the outlier is based on the first method from this document:
https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E40248_01/epm.1112/cb_statistical/frameset.htm?ch07s02s10s01.html
The second subplot therefore zooms in on the range minimum to the maximum GDP excluding the outlier which is: 55100, the GDP from Luxembourg.
